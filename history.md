The information below was collected by Ann Daggett, who spoke with many people from the neighborhood, and was confirmed by Jack Davenport. It was published in the summer of 1983 as a pamphlet that was produced by Beryl Wells and handed out to Wrinkle Pointers and newcomers when they moved in. Enjoy!

"Wrinkle Point" is to the West'ard at the mouth of Bass River, so named because at the beginning of things in this town, "wrinkles" or "winkles" were so plentiful around the thatch they were used for food. Tradition has it that on "wash out" days during the salt industry of a century or more ago, winkle dinners were served right on the shore. A crackling fire was built of driftwood, iron pots were hung on a rod supported by tri-pods, and the winkles, deadly enemy of oysters and quahogs, were tossed into the pot for boiling. What a treat for our summer folks!

In the days when West Dennis was a fishing village, there was a section of the village extending from Ferry Street, then the main road through town, to the river on one side and Loring Avenue on the other. This was called Wrinkle Point. When Davenport Realty Trust purchased the southwest corner of this land from James and Charles Buckley on March 1, 1956, the name Wrinkle Point continued to be used.

Every resident of the Point has benefited by John Davenport's generous and farsighted decision to leave the most desirable parcel of land, which commands a beautiful view of Bass River and Nantucket sound, open as communal property. This also includes Buckley Beach. What we know now as Wrinkle Point was for many years a beautiful picnic spot for local folks. Abounding with lady slippers, pink trailing arbutus, blueberries and beachplums; traces of these can still be found today!
