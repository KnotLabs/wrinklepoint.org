**Wrinkle Point Pool Policies**

Pool hours are 8:00am to 10:00pm. If you are identified as a user of the pool after 10:00pm, you and your family may lose your pool privileges.

Children under sixteen are not allowed to swim in the pool unless supervised by an adult. An adult is defined as a parent or other responsible person over the age of eighteen. If children are sent to the pool without an adult they will not be allowed in the fenced-in pool area until the adult arrives.

Only members who are homeowners in Wrinkle Point and their guests are allowed to use the pool. A homeowner refers to the person on the deed of the house, their spouse and their children. A guest may not use the pool unless a homeowner is with them at the time.

Behavior. Many of the pool complaints we get relate to how children and teenagers are acting in the pool. Please remind the children you are responsible for their playing in a manner that shows respect for others' safety and comfort. Running is dangerous, and there should be no horseplay.

Large Crowds. We cannot accommodate large crowds. We have not had to enforce the pool limit in the past, and we hope people will use good judgment to keep this from happening. The filter system continually requires additional maintenance after a crowded day at the pool.

Proper swimming attire is required, and children who are not potty trained must wear proper diapers. It is very costly and time consuming to restore the pool after an "accident."

Pool Attendants are instructed to enforce all safety policies. Their hours are from 10am to 5pm. Remember the Pool Attendant is not a babysitter at the pool!

Reserving lounges or tables before arriving at the pool is not allowed. First come first used is the policy.

Renters are not allowed to use the pool.

Remember ‐ it is a state law that the gate remains closed at all times. Also there should be no swinging on the gate or kicking/pulling the gate without using the appropriate key. It is very costly to repair.

Please drive very carefully and slowly around the pool. Children running out of the pool cannot be seen because of the sight lines and volume of activity.

Please do not admit someone who does not have a key.

There should be no solo swimming.

A shower is required before swimming, and by law, people with a communicable disease are not allowed in the pool.

MOST IMPORTANT ‐ NO GLASS MATERIAL AT THE POOL.

Dogs are not allowed inside the pool area.

Large inflatable floats are not allowed.

Please do not allow the children to use the chairs for play, such as making forts. It is dangerous, and they are very costly to replace and repair.

It would be unfortunate for anyone violating these policies to forfeit their pool rights and not be able to use the pool. Through your actions and behavior, please respect those around you so this wonderful amenity can be enjoyed by all.

We will continue trying to keep your pool running properly, keeping the work and costs down and have it looking nice.
